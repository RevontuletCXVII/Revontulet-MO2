# Revontulet's MO2 Themes
Repository for MO2 themes made by me.

# I highly recommended using the [ModdingLinked version of Mod Organizer 2](https://github.com/ModdingLinked/ML-ModOrganizer2) with this theme. It fixes numerous issues with colouring and text, thanks to using an updated version of QtStyles.
